# My First Repository

This is the first repository I created using OpenClaw. It contains a simple Flask application for image compression.

## Setup (for local development)

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/resumemo/my-first.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-first
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Pillow
    ```
4.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

Then, open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the image compressor.
